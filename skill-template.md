# Skill Creation Template

**Use this template to create domain-specific skills for your academic workflow.**

---

## When to Create a Custom Skill

Create a skill when you find yourself:
- Repeatedly explaining the same 3+ step workflow to Claude
- Needing domain-specific quality checks (citation style, notation consistency, lab protocols)
- Enforcing field-specific output formats (thesis structure, journal templates, lab notebooks)
- Coordinating multi-tool workflows (Figma → R → LaTeX, data → analysis → manuscript)

**Don't create a skill for:**
- One-time tasks
- Workflows that change frequently
- Simple 1-2 step operations

## Template Structure

Copy the structure below to `skills/your-skill-name.md`:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: [What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key capabilities]. Use when user asks for "[trigger phrase 1]", "[trigger phrase 2]", or "[context]".
argument-hint: "[brief hint for user]"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash", "Task"]
disable-model-invocation: true

# [Skill Name]

[One sentence: what this skill accomplishes and why it exists]

## Instructions

Step 1: [First major action with clear explanation]
   - Detail: [Important consideration]
   - Example: [Concrete example]

Step 2: [Second major action]
   - Detail: [Important consideration]

Step 3: [Final action and verification]
   - Verify: [What to check]
   - Output: [What user receives]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Common Scenario Name]
**Context:** [When this occurs]
**User says:** "[Typical user request]"
**Actions:**
1. [What skill does first]
2. [What skill does second]
3. [Final output]
**Result:** [What user receives]

### Example 2: [Another Common Scenario]
**Context:** [Different situation]
**User says:** "[Alternative phrasing]"
**Actions:**
1. [Different path through the skill]
**Result:** [Expected outcome]

## Troubleshooting

**Error:** [Common error message or symptom]
**Cause:** [Why this happens]
**Solution:** [How to fix it]

**Error:** [Another common issue]
**Cause:** [Root cause]
**Solution:** [Fix steps]
```

## Writing Effective Descriptions

The `description` field determines when Claude loads your skill. Use this structure:

```
[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key capabilities]
```

### Good Examples (Field-Specific)


**Econometric Specification Review (Economics):**
```yaml
description: Reviews econometric specifications for common errors. Use when user shares regression code in R or Stata, or asks to "check model spec", "review estimation". Validates: standard error clustering, fixed effects structure, missing covariates, and replication commands.
```

### Bad Examples (Too Generic)

❌ `description: Helps with citations`
→ Too vague, doesn't specify style or when to trigger

❌ `description: Checks lab notebooks`
→ Missing trigger phrases, no format specification

❌ `description: Reviews thesis chapters`
→ Doesn't specify what aspects or when to activate



## Testing Your Skill

### Step 1: Manual Test
1. Create skill directory: `mkdir -p skills/your-skill-name`
2. Copy SKILL.md template and customize
3. Restart Claude Code or run `/reload` if available
4. Trigger skill: Use one of your trigger phrases
5. Verify: Skill loads, instructions are clear, output is correct

### Step 2: Iteration
- **If skill doesn't trigger:** Revise description with more specific trigger phrases
- **If instructions unclear:** Add more examples and detail to Steps
- **If output wrong:** Add validation steps, troubleshooting section

### Step 3: Success Criteria
- ✅ Skill triggers on 90%+ of relevant queries
- ✅ Complete workflow in expected number of steps
- ✅ Zero API errors during normal operation
- ✅ Same task yields consistent outputs across sessions

## Field-Specific Customization Checklist

When adapting this template to your domain:

- [ ] Replace example trigger phrases with your field's terminology
- [ ] Add domain-specific file types (`.R`, `.py`, `.ipynb`, `.tex`, `.stan`)
- [ ] Include field conventions (notation, formatting, citation styles)
- [ ] Reference standard tools (`ggplot2`, `pandas`, `TikZ`, `Stata`)
- [ ] Add common error messages from your toolchain
- [ ] Include institutional requirements (thesis formats, journal templates)

## Allowed Tools Reference

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `Read` | Reading file contents (scripts, manuscripts, data) |
| `Write` | Creating new files (reports, tables, outputs) |
| `Edit` | Modifying existing files in place |
| `Grep` | Searching file contents (citations, function names) |
| `Glob` | Finding files by pattern (*.R, *.tex, *.csv) |
| `Bash` | Running commands (R scripts, LaTeX compilation, git) |
| `Task` | Launching subagents (for complex multi-step workflows) |

**Security note:** Only grant `Bash` access if your skill needs to execute code or compile documents. For read-only validation skills, omit it.
